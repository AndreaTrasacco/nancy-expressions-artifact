# About the examples

This folder contains a number of examples of use of the Nancy.Expressions library. The snippets of code are contained inside interactive notebooks.

> Notebooks allow to write and execute snippets of code (called "cells") and immediately see their outputs.

# Requirements

To run these notebooks you will need to install:
 
 * .NET SDK ([here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download))
 * Visual Studio Code ([here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)) 
 * *Polyglot Notebooks* extension ([here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode))

Then you can open a notebook (a `.dib` file) from VS Code.
